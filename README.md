# Hi, I’m Adit Sharma

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago (Class of ’28, Software Engineering). My academic and project work sits at the intersection of **systems programming, security, and machine learning**, where I enjoy building reliable, test-driven solutions. I approach problems by breaking them into measurable parts, designing for failure, and documenting decisions clearly so others can build on my work.

In the last year, I developed a **container vulnerability scanner** that reduced CI image-scan time by about 90%, a **C++ authentication and authorization service** capable of handling 500+ concurrent sessions with salted SHA-256 hashing, and a **network traffic analyzer and IDS in C** that achieved ~95% detection accuracy using deep packet inspection. Alongside this, I pursued research applying **transformer embeddings to anomaly detection**, benchmarking modern approaches against classical baselines. These experiences strengthened not only my technical depth but also my ability to collaborate through code reviews, secure design practices, and debugging at the system level with tools such as gdb and Valgrind.

Looking forward, I want to contribute to teams that care deeply about **security, systems infrastructure, or ML tooling**, where correctness, observability, and maintainability are valued. My goal is to apply a rigorous engineering mindset to projects that matter—whether in securing software supply chains, scaling backend systems, or developing ML-driven detection frameworks.
